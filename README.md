# Deep Learning for Cancer Detection

This repository contains scripts, outputs, and visualisations for my MSc dissertation project on **Deep Learning for Cancer Detection**.  
The work involves preprocessing, training, and evaluating segmentation models (nnU-Net) on the **BraTS 2021** and **BCBM Radiogenomics** datasets, with an emphasis on cross-domain generalisation and robustness testing.

## Note on Script Names
The scripts in this repository are **unnamed or inconsistently named** because of a last-minute GitHub push issue that deleted my original script files.  
To avoid losing my work entirely, I recovered and backed them up directly from the local environment.  
As a result:
- Some filenames may not match their original purpose.
- Functionality is intact, but file names may require cross-checking with the commit history or internal comments.
- **Clarification:** The folder named `nnunet_frozenencoder` does **not** contain a fully frozen encoder implementation. Several training attempts were made, but none kept the encoder fully frozen; however, the folder retained the original name from early experiments
